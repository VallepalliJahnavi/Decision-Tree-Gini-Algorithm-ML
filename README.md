# Decision-Tree-Gini-Algorithm-ML
Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. A decision tree represents a series of decisions that lead to a final decision or outcome. Each decision is based on a specific feature or attribute of the data.

One important aspect of building a decision tree is determining which feature to split on at each decision node. The Gini impurity is one method for measuring the quality of a split. The Gini impurity measures the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element from the set. A split with low Gini impurity indicates that the resulting subsets are mostly homogeneous in terms of the target variable, while a split with high Gini impurity indicates that the subsets are more mixed.

The formula for the Gini impurity is as follows:

Gini_impurity = 1 - Î£ (pi)^2

where pi is the probability of an element in the set being classified to a particular class. The Gini impurity ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 0 indicating a perfectly homogeneous subset and a value of 1 indicating a perfectly mixed subset.

When building a decision tree using the Gini impurity, the algorithm will search for the split that results in the lowest weighted average of Gini impurity across the resulting subsets.
